In this exercise, everyone should use the source 
code (skeleton) written for each of the four problems 
(01. Mammal, 02. Vehicle, 03. Hero, and 04. Student)
from the Testing exercise. You have the structure and 
functionality of the classes, and now you should test them.
You are NOT ALLOWED to change the class. Cover the whole 
class with unit tests to make sure that the class is working as intended. 
Submit only the test folder.
